 Makefile          - The makefile.

 FindComponents.c  - The main function that uses the Graph ADT to 
                     interact with files in order to read in a set of verticies
                     and arcs and then print to an out file a preset algorithm,
                     including finding the strongly connected components.

 Graph.c           - The Graph ADT that manages the Graph operations. Centered
                     around Depth First Search.

 Graph.h           - The header file to the Graph ADT.

 GraphTest.c       - The test file to the Graph ADT.

 List.c            - The List ADT that manages the lower level
                     operations that make up the Graph operations.

 List.h            - The header file to the List ADT.
